## Dataset Features

The synthetic dataset includes **2,000 students** with the following features:

| Feature | Description | Range |
|---------|-------------|-------|

| **attendance_percentage** | Class attendance rate | 20% - 100% |
| **previous_gpa** | Previous academic GPA | 0.0 - 4.0 |
| **age** | Student age | 18 - 25 years |
| **passed** | Target variable | 0 (Failed) / 1 (Passed) |

### Data Distribution

![Data Distribution](data_distribution_plots.png)

**Key Insights:**
- **Pass Rate**: 85.4% of students pass
- **Study Hours**: Most students study 2-4 hours per week (gamma distribution)
- **Attendance**: High attendance correlation with passing (mean: ~85%)
- **Clear Separation**: Passing students show distinct patterns in study habits

## Feature Correlations

![Correlation Matrix](correlation_matrix.png)

**Correlation Analysis:**
- **Attendance ↔ Pass**: 0.366 (strongest predictor)
- **Study Hours ↔ Pass**: 0.231 (moderate correlation)
- **Previous GPA ↔ Pass**: -0.017 (surprisingly low)
- **Age ↔ Pass**: 0.011 (minimal impact)

**Ranking by Importance (Permutation Method):**
1. **Attendance Percentage** (0.032) - Most critical factor
2. **Study Hours per Week** (0.003) - Secondary importance
3. **Previous GPA** (0.002) - Minimal impact
4. **Age** (0.002) - Least important

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
```

### Running the Model
```python
# 1. Train the model
python academic_performance_model.py

# 2. Load trained model for predictions
import tensorflow as tf
import joblib
import numpy as np

# Load the best model and scaler
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('best_model_checkpoint.h5')
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')

# Make predictions for new students
new_student = np.array([[10.0, 90.0, 3.2, 20]])  # [study_hours, attendance, gpa, age]
new_student_scaled = scaler.transform(new_student)
prediction = model.predict(new_student_scaled)[0][0]

if prediction > 0.5:
    print(f"PASS (Probability: {prediction:.3f})")
else:
    print(f"FAIL (Probability: {prediction:.3f})")
```

### Example Predictions
```
Student 1: Study Hours: 12.0, Attendance: 95%, Previous GPA: 3.5, Age: 20
  Prediction: PASS (Probability: 0.974)

Student 2: Study Hours: 3.0, Attendance: 65%, Previous GPA: 2.0, Age: 19  
  Prediction: FAIL (Probability: 0.284)

Student 3: Study Hours: 8.0, Attendance: 85%, Previous GPA: 3.0, Age: 21
  Prediction: PASS (Probability: 0.789)
```

## Requirements

```txt
tensorflow>=2.13.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
seaborn>=0.12.0
joblib>=1.3.0
```

## Model Deployment

### Loading the Model
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import joblib

# Load the best checkpoint model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('best_model_checkpoint.h5')
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')
```

### Preprocessing New Data
```python
def preprocess_student_data(study_hours, attendance, gpa, age):
    """Preprocess student data for prediction"""
    student_data = np.array([[study_hours, attendance, gpa, age]])
    return scaler.transform(student_data)

def predict_performance(study_hours, attendance, gpa, age):
    """Predict student performance"""
    processed_data = preprocess_student_data(study_hours, attendance, gpa, age)
    probability = model.predict(processed_data)[0][0]
    prediction = "PASS" if probability > 0.5 else "FAIL"
    return prediction, probability
```

## Business Impact

### Use Cases
- **Early Warning System**: Identify at-risk students early in the semester
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus support on students with low predicted performance
- **Academic Planning**: Help students understand the importance of attendance and study habits
- **Institution Analytics**: Track trends in student performance predictors

### Key Insights
1. **Attendance is King**: 3x more important than study hours for predicting success
2. **Diminishing Returns**: Very high study hours (>12/week) show minimal additional benefit
3. **Age Independence**: Student age has virtually no impact on performance
4. **GPA Paradox**: Previous GPA shows surprisingly low correlation with current performance

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Real Dataset Integration**: Adapt model for actual student data
- [ ] **Additional Features**: Include assignment scores, participation, socioeconomic factors
- [ ] **Multi-class Classification**: Predict letter grades (A, B, C, D, F)
- [ ] **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better accuracy
- [ ] **Real-time Dashboard**: Web interface for educators
- [ ] **Intervention Recommendations**: Suggest specific actions for at-risk students
